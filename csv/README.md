# CSV and C

We've gotten some questions from students how to parse a CSV file in
C. We've also gotten a few questions in another course (Java) on how
to do it in C. Ok let's give an example which we can use in a lab
we've written [Exposing data over http](http://wiki.juneday.se/mediawiki/index.php/Assignment:Exposing_data_over_http). In
this lab the students get a CSV parse written in Java and should
expose and consume the data using JSON.

The original lab/assignment is about fixing the so called "Open API"
offered by Systembolaget, a government-owned chain of liquor stores in
Sweden. The "Open API" is actually a static XML file. Ok, it's updated
daily but it's not an API. The students should download the XML file,
put the products in a database and expose the products using JSON.
